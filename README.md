## üîç About Me  
One of the main contributing factors of my decision to pursue cybersecurity was to be a part of a cyber community that is willing to push for a change in the digital realm. **Innocent people should not have their services and privacy compromised because of vulnerabilities in the systems they rely on or a lack of proper threat mitigation**. I want to be part of a cyber community that works to solve these challenges and **create a safer online environment.**

üöÄ **Cybersecurity Advocacy & Innovation**  
I am committed to **pushing the boundaries of security solutions**, exploring advancements like:
- **Ethical hacking & penetration testing** to proactively identify and mitigate vulnerabilities
- **Blockchain technologies** to fortify security frameworks  
- **AI-driven authentication**, utilizing behavioral analysis to fight AI with AI  
- **Passkey authentication**, replacing traditional username-password models to enhance protection  

üîé **Looking Ahead**  
As I progress in my career, I want to drive **user-focused security innovations**, ensuring that cybersecurity adapts to new challenges. I am excited to **connect, collaborate, and innovate** with fellow professionals dedicated to safeguarding the digital world!
