#### Cybersecurity
My name is Gustavo Balaguera. I am a current student majoring in Cybersecurity at Stevens Institute of Technology, and I strive to be among those who have achieved positive and influential success. I have received education from the SANS Technology Institute through the generosity of the CyberStart America program provided by the National Cyber Scholarship Foundation. In addition, I earned my GIAC certification in foundational cybersecurity technologies. I'm proud to be among the top 2% of competitors in Cyberstart and hold the title of National Cyber Scholar with Honors for the 2022 and 2023 competitions. My goal is consistent across the board: to succeed for myself and all who benefit in the digital realm.
