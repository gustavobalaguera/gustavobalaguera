## Current Projects
I am currently navigating a period of academic rigor, with examinations and extensive coursework necessitating a temporary reprioritization of my personal endeavors. Despite these challenges, I am actively developing ‚ÄúCyberNotes,‚Äù a long-term project that reflects my deepening understanding of Cybersecurity. ‚ÄúCyberNotes‚Äù is envisioned as a comprehensive online resource, compiling insights from diverse sources to facilitate a seamless progression from academic study to professional practice for aspiring cybersecurity professionals.

Furthermore, I am in the process of completing a Python script I have developed, named ‚ÄúIgnotus,‚Äù which leverages TCP protocols to facilitate data transmission between server and client interfaces. In pursuit of broadening my expertise in programming, I am also contemplating the design of a graphical user interface (GUI) for this application.
